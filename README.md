## Projects

### Python:
- [Global Prosperity Analysis](https://github.com/russ-jam876/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Global%20Prosperity%20Index): Utilized Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, exploration and visualizations to compare prosperity indicators across different regions, analyze strengths and weaknesses of each region and identify key factors that contribute to regional prosperity, investigate the relationships between different prosperity factors, and develop policy recommendations for improving prosperity in a specific region.
- [Loan Risk Analysis](https://github.com/russ-jam876/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Loan%20Risk): Used Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy to load, clean and explore a dataset containing information abput individuals and their loan applications. Using SciPy, I implemented various models and evaluated them using metrics such as accuracy and precision in order to identify the best-performing model for predicting loan acceptances.

### SQL:
- [Bike Sales Analysis](https://github.com/russ-jam876/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Bikes%20Sales%20Analysis): Applied SQL techniques to clean and transform data to conduct an exploratory data analysis in order to uncover patterns and trends in regional performances, customer demographics and profit margins.
- [Employee Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/russ-jam876/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Employee%20Attrition%20Analysis): Utilized SQL to analyze employee attrition within a company based on various factors to gain key insights that can help improve employee retention strategies.
