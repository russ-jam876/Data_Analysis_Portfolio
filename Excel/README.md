 Adidas Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to uncover patterns and trends in Adidas sales data by creating insightful visualizations and analyses in Excel. The project utilizes pivot tables, charts, and a dynamic dashboard with slicers to present data related to sales trends, product share, units sold per retailer, and sales by state and region.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes sales data for Adidas products across various retailers, regions, and states. The key columns include:

- **Product**: Name of the Adidas product.

- **Total Sales**: Total sales amount in dollars for each product.
- **State**: The state in which the sale occurred.
- **Region**: The broader geographic region of the sale.
- **Invoice Date**: The date of the sale.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this analysis are:
1. **Sales Trend**: Analyzing how Adidas sales have changed over time (monthly, quarterly, or yearly).
2. **Product Share**: Identifying the share of each product in overall sales.
3. **Units Sold Per Retailer**: Evaluating which retailers are contributing the most units to Adidas' sales.
4. **Sales by State**: Understanding the geographic distribution of sales at the state level.
5. **Sales by Region**: Analyzing how Adidas products perform across different regions.

## Analysis Performed
To achieve the above objectives, the following steps were undertaken:

### 1. **Pivot Tables**
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Created a pivot table to summarize sales over time, aggregating by month, quarter, and year to identify sales trends.
- **Product Share Analysis**: Used a pivot table to break down total sales by product to see the share each product contributes to the overall sales.
- **Units Sold per Retailer**: Constructed a pivot table to analyze the units sold per retailer, helping to identify top-performing retail partners.
- **Sales by State**: Created a pivot table that shows sales aggregated by state, helping to identify geographic patterns in sales.
- **Sales by Region**: Created another pivot table to show sales data aggregated by region.

### 2. **Charts and Visualizations**
- **Sales Trend Chart**: Created a line chart to display the sales trend over time, providing a clear view of growth or decline in sales.
- **Product Share Chart**: Created a pie chart showing the percentage share of each product in the total sales.
- **Retailer Comparison Chart**: Used a bar chart to compare units sold across retailers.
- **Geographic Sales Distribution**: A map chart to visualize sales by state or region, showing which areas are performing the best.
  
### 3. **Dashboard with Slicers**
- Created a dynamic dashboard that consolidates all the key insights in one place.
- **Slicers**: Added slicers to allow users to interact with the data and view the information by different time periods, products, retailers, states, and regions.
- The dashboard enables quick access to critical metrics such as sales trends, product share, and regional sales performance.

## Key Insights
- **Sales Trends**: The analysis revealed significant fluctuations in sales trends, with certain months/quarters showing spikes, which can be tied to seasonal promotions or events.
- **Product Share**: Specific products are contributing more to Adidasâ€™ overall sales than others, highlighting popular product lines.
